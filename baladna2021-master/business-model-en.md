        Extensive progress was achieved by Baladna during 2021 toward harmonizing incident reporting across the operating companies in each of our business lines, with a view to expanding Group-wide monitoring and management of HSE key performance indicators (KPIs).

        #### Environmental management and emissions monitoring and reduction

        Baladna is committed to being an active member in the UAE’s emissions reduction journey, including the national net-zero by 2050 strategic initiative.  In 2021, we participated in UAE government climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target-setting mechanisms, such as the Abu Dhabi Climate Change Task Force, the Government Accelerator Program, the High- Level Dialogue on Energy (HLDE) and COP26.


        Baladna embarked on an extensive global review of our environmental strategy, including our historic and current GHG measurement guidance, reporting tools and emissions baselines that also informed the development of Baladna’s global environmental strategy and Baladna’s Group strategy, covering:


        - Global environmental reviews and gap analyses of the Group’s environmental management system and their ISO14001 certification


        - Baladna’s GHG emissions baseline and measurement approach of each operating companies’ contribution to the Group’s emissions setting and our energy efficiency roadmap


        Baladna GHG emissions reporting tool used by all operating companies and non-operated companies captures data on scope 1 and scope 2 emissions (e.g. direct emissions from our primary production, generation or distribution activities and our emissions associated with the electricity we purchase). This tool is intended to be extended over time to include a more diverse range of environmental KPIs and definitions. For more information on our sustainability efforts, refer to our latest Sustainability Report.

      title: Baladna has set ambitious growth targets for cleaner and more efficient power generation and waterdesalination in the UAE and beyond as part of our 2030 strategy. We’ve taken significant strides towards achieving these ambitions in 2021 while enhancing inhouse capabilities and further optimizing our operating portfolio. Demonstrating our focus and strength, Baladna is building on several landmark partnerships and investments.

        Supplying more than 90% of Abu Dhabi’s power and water, Baladna’s Generation business comprises a total of 23 GW* of gross operating power generation capacity, including 1.2 GW of renewable energy, and 913 MIGD of water desalination.


        We have 14 assets in the UAE, including independent water and power plants. In addition, decommissioning is beginning with Taweelah A2, offset by an additional three projects under construction. The Generation business has six international assets located across Ghana, India, Morocco, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United States, with 4.9 GW of gross power generation capacity internationally and a further 940 MW under construction.


        Meanwhile, Baladna’s desalination capacity in the UAE stands at 913 MIGD, with a further 205 MIGD under development.


        Baladna’s Generation business plays a key role in the overall growth strategy of the
        organization.

      strategies:
        - text: >+
            Increase gross power capacity from 18 GW to 30 GW in the UAE and add up to 15 GW internationally

        - text: >+
            Expand highly efficient reverse osmosis technologies to make up two-thirds of desalination capacity with 205 MIGD already under construction

        - text: >+
            Focus on clean energy – including solar photovoltaic (PV) – to comprise more than 30% of the power generation portfolio by 2030, up from the current 5%

        In 2021, the Transmission & Distribution business continued to show a strong
        operational performance both in power and water.


        Our transmission power asset availability was at 99.03%, and the transmission water asset availability was at 97.76%, both above the regulatory requirement, whereas service availability – which measures our ability to meet customer demand, was 99.99%


        In distribution, the duration of service interruptions continued to decrease to an average of 81.2 minutes, a 3.4% improvement compared to 2020.
